			<p class="description">The former Whites striker is backing his old side to earn promotion back to the English top flight after a 15-year absence. Former Leeds striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink says the Premier League would benefit from the presence of his old side should they earn promotion this season.</p>
			<p>Leeds haven’t been in the top division since 2004, when they were relegated with huge debts following several years of off-field turmoil. A desperate fire sale of their key players followed, but that had an obvious effect on off-field performance, resulting in their relegation two years later.</p>
			<p>The Yorkshire club even dropped down into League One in 2007, the first time they had been in England’s third tier in their 99-year history.</p>
			<p>“They need and deserve to be in the Premier League even if it’s just because of the fans who always create such an atmosphere at Elland Road. Also the numbers they take to the away games – it’s always lively. There are only a few clubs in the Championship who would make the Premier League better and Leeds is one of them.</p>
			<p>“I’m extremely happy with how they’re playing – it’s such good football and nice to the eye and I’ve been to see Bielsa at Leeds to find out what they’re doing and how they’re doing it. He is an exceptional coach.”</p>
			<p>Leeds are currently third in the Championship table, just two points behind leaders Norwich, raising hopes among the supporters that the club will soon return to the top division.</p>
