			<p class="description">The Reds are better equipped than in previous seasons to handle their tough upcoming schedule, according to the defender. Liverpool defender Joe Gomez believes strength in depth will help the title contenders escape unscathed from their congested fixture list.</p>
			<p>Liverpool have 10 matches between now and the end of the year that could make or break their hopes of snatching the silverware away from Manchester City..</p>
			<p>"In past seasons I think it's been a really defining period in the season for us," Gomez told his club's website.</p>
			<p>"So we know how important it is and how tough it's going to be with the amount of games [there are] in a short period of time, but we're ready.</p>
			<p>"All teams in the Premier League face this same task and we've just got to be ready for it and try to get as many points as we can.</p>
			<p>Fellow defender Trent Alexander-Arnold echoed his team-mate's comments on the eve of a tricky trip to seventh-placed Watford. "The club brought in quality players. There's a lot more squad depth, and there are world class players all across the pitch," Alexander-Arnold told Sky Sports.</p>
