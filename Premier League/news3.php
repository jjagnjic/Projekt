			<p>TTable-toppers Liverpool visit Brighton, Tottenham host Manchester United, while Manchester City host Wolves in the Monday night fixture.</p>
			<p>Manchester United face the first major test of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s tenure this weekend, with a trip to in-form Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
			<p>The caretaker manager has made an outstanding start at Old Trafford. Four successive victories against bottom-half opponents were perhaps to be expected, but it is United’s fresh and liberated style of play that marks out a significant shift.</p>
			<p>With greater tempo, fluency and movement, Man Utd have been transformed into a more positive attacking force by the Norwegian. olskjaer has given all of his players the freedom to express themselves, but the club legend has also tinkered gently with the make-up of the team.</p>
			<p>The key for United now is to stick with the principles Solskjaer has introduced. A testing trip to Wembley means they will have less of the ball, but it will be interesting to see if the caretaker manager has raised confidence to the extent that they will still be willing to attack Spurs with the same freedom.</p>
